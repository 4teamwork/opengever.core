# This is implemented as a shell pipeline around a sequential bin/test -vvv run
# Doing this the mtest way would make up for an insanely long runtime

# Tested to work both on macOS Mojave and Centos 7 (bugatti.4teamwork.ch)

# We're not interested in STDERR at all, way too difficult to fish details out
# All tests which get run have a runtime in seconds in parens
# We remove all the parens for clarity
# Reorder and output for readability and sortability: runtime class method
# Do a columnar numerical sort on the first column
# Tee output to a logfile, prefixed by current date
# The output of time is not teed, as that'd add unnecessary complexity here
