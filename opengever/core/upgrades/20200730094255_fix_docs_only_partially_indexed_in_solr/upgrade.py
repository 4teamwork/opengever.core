    """Fix docs only partially indexed in solr.

    We think affected documents may have been not indexed in solr at all due to
    a bug with date serialization in `ftw.solr`. The bug was only fixed in
    https://github.com/4teamwork/ftw.solr/pull/158.

    Subsequent edits of the document by users via plone or reindex operations
    during upgrades would have partially indexed or restored the document in
    solr, but only some of the fields as we use atomic updates.

    We've seen that all affected documents do not have the created date set as
    we never manually reindex it, as it never changes. Thus apply a heuristic
    to detect broken solr documents. We assume that broken documents do not
    have the field 'created' set to a value in solr.
