This module contains functions to help fix issues around Dexterity's
behavior regarding default values.

Default values not being persisted
----------------------------------

In some cases, default values that have been prefilled in a z3c.form form won't
get persisted in the DB, causing an object's fields to "retroactively change"
once the default[Factory] for a field is changed.

Both these cases share a similar pattern: z3c.form checks whether a field's
value has changed or not, and only writes fields whose values it believes
have changed. However, that check gets fooled by __getattr__ fallbacks in
DexterityContent and AnnotationsFactoryImpl that don't raise AttributeError,
but return the field's default or missing_value respectively.

1) - AttributeStorage

Given:

- Field in base schema or a behavior using AttributeStorage
- Field has a default or a defaultFactory

Steps to reproduce:

- Add a new object using the z3c.form add form, leaving the field at its
  prefilled default value (Add & immediately save)
- Change the field's default or defaultFactory in the code

=> The field's value will not have been persisted.

(When displaying the field or reading it programmatically, the new default
will be returned, indicating that the old default has never been persisted.)

This happens because z3c.form checks whether a field has been changed or not
when applying changes, and only saves values that are different
(see z3c.form.form.applyChanges()).

Because plone.dexterity's DexterityContent defines a __getattr__ that falls
back to a field's default instead of raising an AttributeError, for a newly
created object, accessing an attribute that doesn't exist yet will result in
the fields default value.

This will lead z3c.form to comparing the field's default value (prefilled in
the form's widget) with the field's default value (returned by Dexterity's
fallback when accessing a non-existent attribute). Because of that the field's
value is never considered "changed", and therefore won't be written to the
object.

On the surface things appear to have worked though, because Dexterity's
fallback also will dynamically return the default on display / programmatic
read access.

2) - AnnotationStorage

Given:

- Field in a behavior using AnnotationStorage
- Field default that is equal to field's missing_value

Steps to reproduce:

- Add a new object using the z3c.form add form, leaving the field at its
  prefilled default value (Add & immediately save)
- Change the field's default or defaultFactory in the code

=> The field's value will not have been persisted.

In this case, the value isn't being persisted because there is a similar
fallback in AnnotationsFactoryImpl: Instead of raising an AttributeError, it
will fall back to returning the field's missing_value
(see plone.behavior.annotation.AnnotationsFactoryImpl.__getattr__).

This will result in z3c.form.form.applyChanges() comparing the default value
for a field against the field's missing_value - if they happen to be the same,
the field's value will never be persisted.

Approach to fixing the issues
-----------------------------

We attempt to fix the z3c.form related issues where default values won't be
persisted by patching z3c.form.util.changedField(). The idea is to patch it in
a way so that it doesn't just rely on the DataManager to return a field's
value (which would trigger the mentioned fallbacks), but instead uses the
function below to really get to the persisted value for a field, taking the
underlying storage into account. That way we can hopefully avoid any fallbacks
that would fool the check.
