    Usually this means that the lock token strings must match exactly.

    send incomplete tokens, which still need to be accepted.

    We've so far only seen this for the put_file operation, and in these
    two specific variants:
    - The client token is a substring of the server_token
    - The client token looks like JSON, and contains a subset of the key/value
      pairs present in the server_token (with keys in the same order).

    When invoked with strict=False, we also consider these two partial
    matches valid.
