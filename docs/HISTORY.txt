  If the tracking table is created for the first time, it's not visible in
  metadata until the transaction has been committed.

  Therefore we need to have a method that tries to fetch an existing tracking
  table and return it, or if it doesn't exist yet, creates it and then
  returns the created table. In order to keep a reference to the tracking table
  across several SchemaMigration upgrade steps, a module global is used.
