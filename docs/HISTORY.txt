  Replaced old custom form with a z3c wizard-form and allow to attach documents.
  [phgross]

- Strip elements that are not supported by Sablon from trix-input.
  Also log to sentry when this happens. We don't expect markup to
  be stripped since the markup generated by trix should always be
  supported by Sablon.
  [deiferni]

- Disallow closing or deactivating a dossier which contains active proposals.
  [phgross]

- Remove fallback-image for mails because bumblebee supports .eml mimetiype now.

  [Kevin Bieri, phgross]

- Fix document overview.
  [Kevin Bieri]

- Fixed textfiltering for task listings on PostgreSQL.
  [phgross]

- Added new attribute decision_draft to proposal, which allows to
  prefill the agendaitem's decision.
  [phgross]

  Normally, the tabbedview is storing the last state (i.e. sorting) per user per tab.
  Since bumblebee requires a proxy view to determine if the list or the gallery should be
  rendered, the mechanism to store and get the state was broken.
  [elioschmutz]

- Initialize the showroom correctly for dynamically loaded items in the search-view.
  [elioschmutz]

- Reindex documents after adding ftw.bumblebee.interfaces.IBumblebeeable to
  make sure object_provides is up to date.

- Enables to replace a checked out document by Drag'n'Drop.
  [phgross]

- Redirect to meeting tab when a meeting has been created.

- Add 'open as pdf' link in the bumblebee overlay.
  [elioschmutz]

- Add Visual Search (Bumblebee) integration using ftw.bumblebee.

  This new feature can be toggled with a feature flag.
  We introduces two new dependencies, ftw.bumblebee to provide the base
  integration and for communicating with the bumblebee service and
  ftw.showroom display the overlay.

  The initial integration also adds the following UI components:

  - A gallery with small preview-thumbnails for documents of a dossier
  - A large preview thumbnail on the document overview
  - Small preview-thumbnails for search-results
  - An overlay to read the document that opens when clicking on
    one of the aforementioned thumbnails and a document in a document
    listing (tab)

- Enable zip-export for personal overview.
  [deiferni]

- Reworked XLSReporter using the openpyxl library instead of xlwt, to support
  xlsx creation.
  [phgross]

- TranslatedTitleBrain: Also use Missing.Value as indicator that a brain
  has no translated title, and should therefore return the regular title.
  [lgraf]

- Make default value for IDossier.start a defaultFactory instead
  of a form level default.
  [lgraf]

  The fix hacks around office's behavior to resolve links prior to opening
  a browser. This lead to an "insufficient privileges" page being displayed if

  redirects to that location.
  [deiferni]

- Disable editing of decided agenda-items in protocol view.
  [elioschmutz]

- Avoid infinite loop in BasicReferenceNumber.get_parent_numbers() if context

  [elioschmutz]

- Adjust proposal tabbedview tab.

  - Remove unused rows: 'initial_position' and 'proposed_action'
  - Add referencenumber row
