- Nothing changed yet.

  [jone]


4.2.1 (2015-03-17)
------------------

- SchemaMigration: Use IdempotentOperations only when executing migrations for MySQL.
  Also make sure that IdempotentOperations always keeps database metadata up to date.
  [deiferni]

- Upgrade: fix meeting upgrade to 4200, also migrate data, not only schema.
  [deiferni]

- Upgrade: add oracle/postgres implementation for upgrade to 4203.
  [deiferni]

  instead of metadata.
  [deiferni]

  [deiferni]

  [phgross]

- SchemaMigration: Make sure transaction is marked as changed even if it
  only contains DDL statements. See zope/sqlalchemy/README.txt#L145-L164
  [lgraf]

- SchemaMigration: Fix tracking table creation for DBs supporting transactional DDL:

  If the tracking table is created for the first time, it's not visible in
  metadata until the transaction has been committed.

  Therefore we need to have a method that tries to fetch an existing tracking
  table and return it, or if it doesn't exist yet, creates it and then
  returns the created table. In order to keep a reference to the tracking table
  across several SchemaMigration upgrade steps, a module global is used.

  Returning the table created by op.create_table requires alembic >= 0.7.0.
  [lgraf]

- Rename UniqueConstraints names of the SubmittedDocument table,
  because of oracle's limitation to 30 chars.
  [phgross]
