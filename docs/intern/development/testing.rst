Performance analysis
====================

We provide convenience scripts to measure the throughput, performance and
relative and absolute runtime weights of various combinations of our testing
stack. These are usually run once per release to try to spot any obvious jumps
in performance for the better or worse. The results are also used as a basis to
inform us on how to optimise the parallel running of the tests on our CI
infrastructure.
