.. Release notes section shouldn't be published quite yet.
..
.. Remove this entire block and simply append the 'release-notes/index.rst'
.. to the toctree above once it should be published.
..
.. Please also remove the :orphan: directive from the top of
.. docs/public/release-notes/index.rst once you do this (that directive
.. prevents Sphinx warning about the release notes section not being included
.. in any toctree).
